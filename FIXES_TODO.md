# Fixes To Implement

## 1. ✅ Login Screen Text - FIXED
- Changed glitch effect to subtle flash
- Text now stays visible
- Glitch only appears occasionally

## 2. Layout Restructuring
- Remove bottom player bar
- Remove left visualizer
- Move vinyl visualizer + controls to right side panel
- Make it a permanent fixture

## 3. Profile Tab Content
- Add profile view to the Profile tab
- Show user info, stats, edit options
- Not just a modal

## 4. Settings Overhaul
- Create tabbed settings interface
- Tabs: Appearance, Audio, Account, About
- Remove volume slider (redundant with player)

## 5. Playlist Interactions
- Left-click playlist → view inside
- Right-click playlist → edit/delete menu

## 6. Playback Toggle
- Clicking playing song should pause it
- Not restart it

## 7. Visual Enhancements
- Add animated backgrounds to other tabs
- Grid lines, floating shapes
- Subtle animations throughout

Let me implement these systematically...
