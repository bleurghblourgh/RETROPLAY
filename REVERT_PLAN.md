# Revert Plan - Back to Working State

## Current Issues
- Vinyl disc stuck in middle
- No buttons visible
- No volume or progress controls
- Autofix keeps breaking CSS

## Solution
Revert to the old working bottom player bar layout, then we can enhance it properly later.

## Steps
1. Restore 2-column layout (sidebar + content)
2. Restore bottom player bar
3. Remove broken vinyl panel
4. Get back to working state
5. Then we can add features incrementally

Let me implement this now...
